    <h1>My Python Journey: 100 Days of Replit Challenge</h1>
    <p>From basic to advanced skills in Pythonâ€”here's how it went!</p>
  </header>
  
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Phase 1: Getting Started â€“ A Walk in the Park</h2>
    <p>When I first took on the <strong>100 Days of Replit in Python</strong> challenge, it was my first official coding challengeâ€”though not my first encounter with Python. By then, I had already acquired a solid understanding of the basics and considered myself at an advanced beginner level. I had spent months learning Python before diving into this challenge, so I wasn't completely new to the language.</p>

    <h2>Phase 2: Stepping Up â€“ Finding the Fun</h2>
    <p>As I progressed, things started to get more interesting. The challenge pushed me to think outside the box and take on problems I hadn't encountered before. I found myself diving deeper into concepts like algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques that I hadnâ€™t fully explored.</p>

    <h2>Phase 3: A Marathon, Not a Sprint â€“ Wrapping Up in 42 Days</h2>
    <p>Although the challenge was meant to take 100 days, I managed to complete it in <strong>42 days</strong>â€”a personal achievement that Iâ€™m quite proud of. I encountered some tough challenges, but each one was a stepping stone towards mastering Python. I had to push myself to stay consistent, and sometimes I struggled, but I learned to embrace the journey.</p>

    <h2>What I Gained</h2>
    <p>Looking back, this challenge was one of the most rewarding experiences in my coding journey so far. It wasnâ€™t always easy, but completing it made me feel like I could tackle any Python problem that comes my way.</p>
    <p>Not only did I improve my Python skills, but I also gained a great deal of <strong>self-confidence</strong>. Sure, there were tough moments, but I knew that with determination, I could push through and emerge stronger. This wasnâ€™t just about learning syntax or librariesâ€”it was about building resilience and problem-solving ability.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The <strong>100 Days of Replit</strong> challenge remains my most favorite coding course/experience to date. It wasn't just about ticking off tasks on a to-do list, but about proving to myself that I could take on and solve real-world coding challenges, one day at a time.</p>
