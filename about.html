        <h1>✨ Who Am I? ✨</h1>
        <p>Hey there, cool cats! 🐾 I’m <strong>Divya</strong>, a 23-year-old code-slingin’, chai-sippin’ tech enthusiast who’s currently diving headfirst into a Master’s in Computer Science. 🎓💻</p>
        
        <p>Let’s get one thing straight—I’m totally in love with <em>web development</em>. 🌐 It’s my happy place where creativity meets logic, and I can whip up websites that don’t just work but <strong>feel like home</strong>. Think smooth animations, bold colors, and retro vibes that would make even an ‘80s arcade blush. 🎮✨</p>
        
        <p>Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m still in that <em>"learning phase”</em> (aren’t we all?). But trust me, I’ve got the passion and enough bookmarked tutorials to build an entire city of websites. 🚀🌆</p>
        
        <div>
          <h2>💡 A Little More About Me:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Planner Extraordinaire 🗂️:</strong> I’m obsessed with structured goals, to-do lists, and the sweet satisfaction of checking things off. ✅</li>
            <li><strong>Go-With-The-Flow Vibes 🌊:</strong> Sometimes, you just gotta roll with it, right? My motto: "Have a plan, but let life surprise you."</li>
            <li><strong>Retro Aesthetic Lover 🎶:</strong> Neon lights, pixel fonts, synthwave soundtracks—yes, please! There’s nothing like adding a splash of vintage charm to modern creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Chai Enthusiast ☕:</strong> Life runs on code and chai breaks—preferably with good company and better conversations.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      
        <p>When I’m not geeking out over code, you’ll find me brainstorming big ideas 💭, jamming to retro beats 🎵, or dreaming about my next creative project. Let’s just say, I’m equal parts quirky and curious—and I wouldn’t have it any other way. 💃✨</p>
      
        <p>So, what’s the vibe here? A little retro, a little futuristic, and a whole lot of <strong>fun.</strong> Let’s connect and create something awesome together! 🌟</p>
