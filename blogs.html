      <h2>My 1st Learning Experience with HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p class="meta">Posted on 13th December,2024 | By Divya</p>

          <h1>My First HTML & CSS Learning Journey</h1>
          <p>From online classes to creating my first mini projects.</p>
        </header>
        
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Phase 1: Diving In - The Commitment</h2>
          <p>When I first started learning <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, I decided to go all in. I enrolled in an online course and committed myself to learning every day. The classes ran from <strong>7:30 AM to 2 PM</strong>, but that was just the beginning. The real work began after that.</p>
      
          <h2>Phase 2: A Project for Every Topic</h2>
          <p>After my classes ended each day, I would dedicate most of my remaining waking hours to practicing what I learned. As a person who truly believes in "learning by doing," I couldn’t just watch videos and take notes. I needed hands-on experience. So, I started building <strong>mini projects</strong>—and I mean *mini*. If you could even call them projects, they were basic but meaningful exercises to reinforce what I was learning.</p>
      
          <h2>Phase 3: Wrapping Up - 7 Days of Progress</h2>
          <p>What began as an overwhelming challenge soon turned into a fun journey. In <strong>7 days</strong>, I managed to complete the course and all of my mini projects. While I knew I wasn't perfect, I had gained a sense of confidence that was new to me.</p>
      
          <h2>What I Gained</h2>
          <p>Finishing this challenge taught me that I don’t have to be perfect to keep moving forward. It gave me the confidence to dive into more advanced topics and projects, knowing I can always improve with practice. I may have been a beginner, but I proved to myself that I had the skills and determination to learn something new and make it my own.</p>
      
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>While I still have a lot to learn in <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, completing this first project was a major milestone in my journey. It was the first step towards the developer I am today—and one I look back on with pride.</p>

      <h2>My 1st official Challenge of Python</h2>
      <p class="meta">Posted on January 15, 2024 | By Divya</p>
      <header>
        <h1>My Python Journey: 100 Days of Replit Challenge</h1>
        <p>From basic to advanced skills in Python—here's how it went!</p>
      </header>
      
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Phase 1: Getting Started – A Walk in the Park</h2>
        <p>When I first took on the <strong>100 Days of Replit in Python</strong> challenge, it was my first official coding challenge—though not my first encounter with Python. By then, I had already acquired a solid understanding of the basics and considered myself at an advanced beginner level. I had spent months learning Python before diving into this challenge, so I wasn't completely new to the language.</p>
    
        <h2>Phase 2: Stepping Up – Finding the Fun</h2>
        <p>As I progressed, things started to get more interesting. The challenge pushed me to think outside the box and take on problems I hadn't encountered before. I found myself diving deeper into concepts like algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques that I hadn’t fully explored.</p>
    
        <h2>Phase 3: A Marathon, Not a Sprint – Wrapping Up in 42 Days</h2>
        <p>Although the challenge was meant to take 100 days, I managed to complete it in <strong>42 days</strong>—a personal achievement that I’m quite proud of. I encountered some tough challenges, but each one was a stepping stone towards mastering Python. I had to push myself to stay consistent, and sometimes I struggled, but I learned to embrace the journey.</p>
    
        <h2>What I Gained</h2>
        <p>Looking back, this challenge was one of the most rewarding experiences in my coding journey so far. It wasn’t always easy, but completing it made me feel like I could tackle any Python problem that comes my way.</p>
        <p>Not only did I improve my Python skills, but I also gained a great deal of <strong>self-confidence</strong>. Sure, there were tough moments, but I knew that with determination, I could push through and emerge stronger. This wasn’t just about learning syntax or libraries—it was about building resilience and problem-solving ability.</p>
    
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The <strong>100 Days of Replit</strong> challenge remains my most favorite coding course/experience to date. It wasn't just about ticking off tasks on a to-do list, but about proving to myself that I could take on and solve real-world coding challenges, one day at a time.</p>

      <h2>My 30 Days codedamn HTML-CSS challenge</h2>

          <h1>My 30 Days HTML & CSS Challenge with Codedamn</h1>
          <p>A fun and challenging journey of building cool stuff with HTML and CSS.</p>
        </header>
        
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Phase 1: The Beginning – A New Challenge</h2>
          <p>When I signed up for the <strong>30 Days HTML & CSS Challenge</strong> by Codedamn, I was excited but also a bit nervous. The challenge promised to help me hone my skills, and I was ready to dive in. It was a great opportunity for practice, and I couldn’t wait to start building.</p>
      
          <h2>Phase 2: The Process – Research and Building</h2>
          <p>As I began working through the challenge, I was amazed at how much I was able to create. From simple layouts to more complex designs, each day brought something new. However, it wasn't always smooth sailing. I found myself frequently Googling for features I hadn’t learned yet. But honestly, this made the process even more rewarding. The search for answers became part of the journey.</p>
          
          <p>It took me about <strong>7 days</strong> to complete the challenge. While that was faster than I expected, it was still a lot of work and required a fair bit of persistence. Some days were tough, but I pushed through and learned so much along the way. The challenge not only sharpened my HTML and CSS skills but also reinforced my problem-solving ability.</p>
      
          <h2>Phase 3: Wrapping Up – The Google Toolkit Realization</h2>
          <p>One of the biggest takeaways from this challenge was the realization of just how crucial Google search is for developers. There’s a meme that circulates about how "Google is a developer's best friend," and now I get it. It became my go-to toolkit for figuring out how to implement certain features, and it worked every time!</p>
      
          <h2>What I Gained</h2>
          <p>Looking back, I’m proud of how much I was able to build in just 7 days. I was able to push my limits and make things I didn’t think I could do before. The real value of this challenge wasn’t just in what I built, but in the confidence it gave me to approach HTML and CSS with more assurance.</p>
      
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>The <strong>30 Days HTML & CSS Challenge</strong> by Codedamn was an enriching experience. While it wasn’t perfect, it gave me a ton of valuable practice and reinforced the idea that persistence and a little bit of Googling can go a long way in coding!</p>
